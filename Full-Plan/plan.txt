Yes 👌 got you. After the **Hero section**, most professional tech/agency websites follow a **proven flow** that guides the visitor step by step.

Here’s the **typical order after the hero** (with what you can do for Kubops):

---

## 🔹 1. Services / Solutions Overview

👉 Right after the hero, people want to know **what you actually offer**.

* Title: *Nos Services* or *Solutions*
* 3–6 cards with icons:

  * **Conseil DevOps**
  * **Migration vers le Cloud**
  * **Automatisation & CI/CD**
  * **Sécurité & Monitoring**
* Each card = icon, short title, 2–3 lines description, “En savoir plus” link.

---

## 🔹 2. Why Choose Us / Key Benefits (Stats or Features)

👉 Show credibility and value.

* Example title: *Pourquoi choisir Kubops ?*
* 3–4 highlight points (icons or small cards):

  * 99.99% disponibilité
  * Réduction des coûts IT
  * Équipe certifiée DevOps
  * +10 projets réussis

---

## 🔹 3. Social Proof (Logos or Testimonials)

👉 Build trust.

* If you have clients → show **logos**.
* If not yet → add 2–3 **testimonial placeholders** (“Kubops a transformé notre infrastructure en 3 mois !”).

---

## 🔹 4. About / Team Intro

👉 Humanize your brand.

* Small paragraph about Kubops.
* Photo of founder/team or an illustration.
* Call to action: *Découvrez qui nous sommes → À propos*.

---

## 🔹 5. Blog / Resources (Optional now, but good later)

👉 Show expertise.

* Title: *Derniers articles*.
* 3 blog cards (title, short text, “Lire plus”).

---

## 🔹 6. Final Call to Action (CTA section)

👉 Close strong.

* Title: *Prêt à transformer vos DevOps ?*
* Button: *Contactez-nous* (primary) + *Planifier un appel* (secondary).

---

## 🔹 7. Footer

👉 Navigation + Contact info.

* Links: Services | À propos | Blog | Contact
* Social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
* Copyright © 2025 Kubops Technology

✅ So the order is:
**Hero → Services → Benefits/Why Us → Social Proof → About → Blog → Final CTA → Footer**

---

👉 Do you want me to **start designing the Services section with you (step by step like we did for Hero)** so you can add it now under your hero?
